Student Course Registration System
A web application for managing student registrations and course enrollments, built with Java, JSP, and Servlets.
Overview
This project simplifies student enrollment and course management, offering a dynamic platform for students and administrators. It leverages JSP for server-side rendering and is deployed on Apache Tomcat. Data persistence is achieved through file handling, using text files instead of a database like MySQL.
Features

User Authentication: Students can sign up (e.g., email, password) and log in securely, with data stored in text files (e.g., students.txt, user_data.txt).
Course Request Management: Students submit course requests via JSP forms, which are reviewed by administrators.
Admin Interface: Admins use a JSP-based dashboard to approve/reject requests and manage profiles.
